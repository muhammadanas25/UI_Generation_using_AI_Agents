#  UI Generator

An AI-powered agentic system for generating rich, multi-section web UIs from high-level descriptions.

## About The Project

 UI Generator is an experimental project that leverages a team of specialized AI agents to automate the process of web design and development. By providing a simple, declarative structure for your website, UI Generator can generate complete page layouts, apply consistent styling, and even create placeholder assets, dramatically speeding up the initial phases of web creation.

The core idea is to move from manual coding of UI components to a higher level of abstraction where you define *what* you want, and a "zoo" of AI agents figures out *how* to build it.
